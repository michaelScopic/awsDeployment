# awsDeployment

Automated deployment for my AWS CSA machines using shell scripts.

## NOTE

### This is **heavily** WIP. Nothing is in a usable state as of now

### This repo was made for Ubuntu x86_64 based machines

## Installation (WIP)

Clone this repo to the machine you want to deploy on:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/michaelScopic/awsDeployment.git
```

Then cd into the repo:

```sh
cd awsDeployment
```

Now lets set everything up with `setup.sh`:

```sh
./setup.sh
```

* Note: If you can't run `setup.sh`, make it executable with `chmod +x setup.sh` and then run the script again.

**WIP**
